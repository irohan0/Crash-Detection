# Crash-Detection
Our team has successfully developed an innovative crash detection model leveraging the powerful YOLOv8 architecture. This cutting-edge solution is designed to provide real-time object detection capabilities, particularly for critical applications like crash detection.

##Key Metrics:

The model's performance metrics are exceptional, boasting a Mean Average Precision (mAP) of 96.6. Additionally, precision and recall scores of 89.1 and 90.2, respectively, showcase the model's robustness in minimizing false positives and false negatives.

##End-to-End Website:

The development of an end-to-end website that not only allows users to access results but also enables them to test our model with their own datasets and test our model in real time. Our website features an intuitive and user-friendly interface, providing clear instructions, and an interactive platform for users to upload and test their own data. The goal is to make the evaluation process seamless and accessible.
