## End-to-End Website:

The development of an end-to-end website that not only allows users to access results but also enables them to test our model with their own datasets and test our model in real time. Our website features an intuitive and user-friendly interface, providing clear instructions, and an interactive platform for users to upload and test their own data. The goal is to make the evaluation process seamless and accessible.
